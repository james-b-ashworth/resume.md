I have structured my career progression to create a hybrid set of job skills. Working from internal audit to learn operational practices, finance to fine tune budgeting processes while creating budgets with a $12B P&L impact, marketing to see the flow of a 100M customer base in a 10-year forecast model, revenue accounting to understand how the systems interact and methods to validate revenues to ensure accurate reports to Wall Street, and lastly to customer experience to work on customer analysis.
